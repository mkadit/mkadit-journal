_"The journey of a thousand miles begin with a single step"_

_- Lao Tzu_

# Early Childhood

Everyone have their own beginning. Be they humble or grand, be they wanting or not.
Everyone has a place to start. A place where their point of life begin. Mine begins
in Cilegon, Banten, a rural place that I doubt any of you ever
heard of (if you do congrats!) despite being born in Jakarta also
known as the capital city of Indonesia.

My earliest memory was that of me sleeping on the floor, hilarious I know. Even until
You all could probably gueesed it from that, but I was a lazy child. When it is time
for me to go to kindergarten I was all but in bed, sleeping, until it was noon when I
should be there at 8.00 A.M. Well that is if I didn't decided to skip attending to play
PS1 instead. I mean Pepsiman was a lot more interesting than learning how to read
so could you blame me?

Of course that didn't mean that I spent my early days all stuffed in a room playing
Pepsiman all day (please, I play Tetris as well mind you). Every once in a while I
would chose (or rather forced) to go outside. It's not bad since I got to ride a rickshaw
and travelled around (which I love to the point I use it for my daily transportation).
![rickshaw](/assets/images/becak.jpg) To the mall, to the pool, to the market,
I would travel to a lot of places. It got to the point that I would go outside
and travel once a week at minimum despite.

If you think that's a hassle then you haven't seen nothing yet. I would wear shoes
anywhere and anytime (yes even the bathroom, I would constantly ask for new games
(now of which I had to pay with my own cash :cry:), and I would not eat any
vegetables at all (actually I still do).

Yup, I was troublesome kid indeed.

# Innocent Days

It was just after I graduate kindergarten (if you could call it that) that
my parents decided to move somewhere else. Depok, a city located near Jakarta. Lovely
place with a few malls, and schools. It's also where the University of Indonesia is
located in case you didn't know but I digress.

It had been two weeks since I graduate, two weeks since my mother had told me I would
not be going to school anymore. Suffice to say I had quite a scare, I thought I wasn't
going to school anymore which lead me to keep asking my parents day and night, seven
days a week, 24 hours in a single day when will I go to school.

Shocking I know, even now I still wonder if it's a dream or not. Were it not for me
actually remember that I would have dismissed such notion as nothing more than lies
, but alas reality proof otherwise. Back then other than my trusty old PS2, TV, and
my daily travel with the rickshaw school was pretty much the only entertaiment I have
left. That and mom would scared me by saying monsters would eat those that didn't
go to school.

So begin my days of learning, mostly. Elementary school was a novel experience
for it was the first time that I am forced to actually attend school. It was alsothe first
time that I am forced to learn something with no option of backing out. Simply put it was
a pain, so much pain that I didn't put any effort on learning in school and just play around
day by day, be it in light or in night, my friends and I continue to play. Soccer? We there
were matches between classes held daily. Video Games? Once in a week we would gather in someone's
house to play. Online Games? It would be strange for us to _not_ play. All in all it was fun,
with the many things I played with my friends and all.

Needless that such actions bore consequences, my scores were... Inadequate you could say.
Part of it was due to me playing too much, but most of it was because I didn't know what
tests are for which prompt me not to take the test (yes,
little me was quite weird in the head) seriously. As a result of that I got one big sermon
and tongue lashing at the end of Elementary School.

# Lazyness Redefined

Junior Highschool was a place of many changes for me. The most important among them would be
that I actually study in class and done my work. Another aspect that had changed was the
fact that I manage to tone down my desire to play and instead allocated them to reading
, which I found to be quite a chore in elementary. Though to be fair I didn't read any
textbook but novels and comics instead.

Academically wise, my grades were leagues beyond what I have in Elementary School. I was
top of the class, the cream of the top, most of the time excluding gym and arts in which
you might find me down there at the abyss moaning in despair of how inept I am at the
subject.

Socially wise I was an avid follower of the going home club! Every chance I possess I would
go home as quickly as possible, except for the time that I actually have to attend a _real_
club since they were mandatory. Doesn't mean I'm a loner though, sorry to burst your bubble.
I have plenty of friends (yes they are real), and interact with them daily.

All in all, my Junior Highschool life was pretty good. I would rate it 8/10, and would do it
again if I were to suddenly re-lived my life due to some unforseen and unexplainable phenomena.

# To Sleep or Not to Sleep

I was once a happy and dandy child. One filled with ambition, one filled with happiness, and is
ignorant of the cruelty of the world. One who knew not of bloodshed and deadlines, who would
be able to sleep with a smile on my face and would be able to rest without having any second
thoughts plaguing my mind.

Then I became a Highschool Student.

We all know what happened after that. Materials starting to not make sense, homeworks left and right,
and the constant threat of quiz always resides within our minds. Truly a dangerous and taxing task,
a trial unlike any other. One that spans for three years each year more arduous than before. It
truly was a miracle that I survived it.

Even in trouble I found a blessing. Though hard Highschool is there are few which I found to be
invaluable. My horizon broaden, I met interesting people (one of them is a harem protagonist) and
befriend them as well, pick up a few hobbies and manage to express them (albeit failed but I digress).

Highschool was a controversial one. On one hand I would suffer everyday yet on the other I gained many
important things as well. I wouldn't say it was horrible, but there are a few things I would like to
change if I was able to (such as not being that much of a loner).

Thus mark the end of my prologue. Quite a short tale is it not? Truthfully speaking there are a few
things I could have mention (like my transition into a night owl), but I figure it would be boring.
On the off chance it's not I would probably ramble on and began to wonder off topic so I decided to
just cut them loose. Maybe I'll write about them if I found them to be interesting, until then farewell!
