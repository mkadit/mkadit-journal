Elequiness, Ruler of Water, was not amused. Another day had passed where his
masculinity was questioned, was he truly that effeminate? Granted spirits do
not possess genders but for the last hundrednof years he had announced himself
as a male. It was one thing for The Demon Lord to questioned him, Creator knows
just how many poor bastards the whimsical Ruler of the Underworld had annoyed
with his constant insult, but it was another thing to be mistaken as a woman by
humans. Heck even his contractor, the ever adorable and sweet Maes, mistook him
for a woman when they first met and still is sometimes when he was drunk!

Posing in front of the mirror (crafted by his gifted children) he wondered how
could anyone mistook him for a man. His clear sky hair that reach his waist
aside, he's pretty sure the rest of his body should be oozing with masculinity.
His face is something that would draw the attention of many creations many
times people would stop to take a look at him, his body though may not be
filled with muscle is lean and firm, his legs long and smooth, and he was
pretty friendly to boot.

Overall people should've labeled him as a friendly gentleman instead.

What was it that makes others so confused of his preferred gender? He
asked this to his siblings, and received many responses. Terra, blessed the kind
the Ruler of Earth, had kindly told him that it was due to how he acts which of
course puzzle him, but she probably didn't lie. Minerva the Ruler of Wind ever
so silently offer nothing but pointing his finger to his face. When he asked
him to clarify the Ruler of Flame and his ~friend~ rival Ignis, she called
it was due to how weak looking she is. He retorted that at least he was better
looking than the muscle looking girl, suffice to say another portion of The
Garden was blown away when he and the Banshee decided curse at each other.

The next person he decided to ask was his father, Eldrid The Lord of Curse and
Punishment. Of course when he did he just smiled at him and pat his head,
asking how his days was. He pouted at the lack of answer but response to his
question, he was a filial son after all.

With four failed he decided to ask the one person who would answer him,
neverminding how much teasing he would have to endure. Shuddering at the
thought Elequiness wondered how the Demon World still stood with someone more
mischief than the Son Who Change Genders stood as its ruler. He felt bad for
those who had the unfortunate pleasure of meeting him and got his attention,
his father came to mind one of colorful foam on his rarely smiling face and the
enraged face of the Man Who Threw Lighting when he found his pristine white
mansion is covered in dark ooze of slimes (courtesy to the Sovereign of
Tempest).

But he wasn't that bad. Sure The Bastard whims are plenty with most
of them borderline causing war between Constellations and his words are sharp
enough that many would want his head, but he wasn't a bad person. It was through
him that the Demon World unite ending the devastation brought by the demons in
their millennium civil war. It was by his desire that grant sanctuary to the
Nephalem when rest of creation sought to annihilate them. It's because of his
whims that the Kingdom of Man still stand despite having nearly no power during
the war.

Still it doesn't make talking with The Whimsical Ruler easier.

A shudder whent through his spine.

It looks like he'll be a subject to another of The Demon Lord's whims.
