Hero and Demon Lord, since the concept of story was born none held a candle to
the epic saga between heroes in their quest to fight against demon lords.
Their relationship was not as simple as many would've thought, they were
enemies, but they can't simply be written as a foe to be conquered. Hatred,
friendship, affection many emotions were felt between the two through ages. A
pair were bitter enemies, another rivalry, one had comradeship between another,
and one even hold affections for each other. The relationship between a hero
and a demon lord are different between one another, except for one thing.

Above anyone else a demon lord shall always acknowledge heroes. Be they come
from a royal family, or were born as a slave? Be their story ends one in
tragedy, or in happiness each and every demon lord acknowledge the life of
heroes.

Till this day, no one knew why all 101 demon lords do such thing. When asked
the heroes who returned would simply show bitter smile and said.

"They, too, understand us"
